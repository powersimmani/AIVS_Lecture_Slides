## 🎯 Learning Objectives

1. Design data splitting strategies (Train/Val/Test)
2. Select and interpret appropriate metrics for regression and classification
3. Evaluate model performance with cross-validation
4. Apply hyperparameter tuning techniques
5. Diagnose and resolve overfitting/underfitting

---

## 📚 Key Topics

**Data splitting**: Train/Val/Test, Stratified Split, Time Series Split
**Regression metrics**: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE
**Classification metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix
**Cross-validation**: K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold, Leave-One-Out
**Tuning**: Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization

## 💡 Key Concepts

- Test set for final evaluation only, Val set for model selection
- Use F1, AUC for imbalanced data
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimation
- Early stopping prevents overfitting
- Perform hyperparameter tuning systematically
