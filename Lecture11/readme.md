## 🎯 Learning Objectives

1. Understand characteristics of sequence data
2. Apply traditional time series techniques (ARIMA)
3. Implement RNN architectures
4. Handle long-term dependencies with LSTM/GRU
5. Design Seq2Seq models

---

## 📚 Key Topics

**Time series basics**: MA, AR, ARMA, ARIMA
**RNN**: Recurrent structure, Hidden state, Backpropagation Through Time
**LSTM**: Cell state, Gates (Forget, Input, Output)
**GRU**: Simplified structure, Reset/Update gates
**Seq2Seq**: Encoder-Decoder, machine translation
