# AI/Deep Learning Excel Worksheets

Learn AI and deep learning concepts by calculating them by hand in Excel spreadsheets.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [ai-by-hand-excel](https://github.com/ImagineAILab/ai-by-hand-excel). The original project's idea has been extended and adapted to fit our lecture curriculum.

## How to Use

1. **Open the file**: Open the `.xlsx` file with Microsoft Excel or compatible software (Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc).

2. **Explore sheets**: Each file contains multiple sheets. Follow them in order to understand the concepts.

3. **Check formulas**: Click on a cell to see the formula used for that calculation. This helps you understand each step of the algorithm.

4. **Modify values**: Change input values and observe how results change. This builds intuition about the impact of each parameter.

5. **Calculate yourself**: Try entering formulas in empty cells to reinforce your understanding.

## Learning Tips

- **Follow the order**: Start from Lecture 03 and progress sequentially.
- **Calculate by hand first**: Before looking at Excel formulas, try calculating by hand and compare results.
- **Use visualization**: Utilize Excel's charting features to visualize data and results.
